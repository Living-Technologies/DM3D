      <h2>Quick Start</h2>
      <p>Start with a 3D image stack, it can have multiple time frames, but should be single channel. The image
        properties need to contain correct pixel dimensions. Then the plugin can be ran.</p>
      <p>Once the plugin start there will be two windows: a 3D screen, which should be empty, and a control panel
        with buttons (described below). Click on the button show volume, and a representation of the image stack should
        appear in the 3D window. Use the -/+ values to adjust the maximum and minimum cutoffs to improve the display.
      </p>
      <p>The next step would be to create a mesh, this can be accomplished by clicking 'initialize mesh...' A dialog
      will appear with three orthogonal views of the image. Clicking on one of the views will start creating a sphere,
      clicking again will finish the sphere. The goal is to contain the desired shape in spheres. The spheres position
      and radius can be adjusted with the blue handles.</p>
      <p>Once the shape is close enough, clicking finish will create a mesh. To have the mesh deform to the image,
        the parameter "image energy" needs to be adjusted, usually start with a small value around 0.001 and click
        "deform mesh". The mesh will be attracted to local bright features. If the mesh deforms too much, then click stop,
        got to the edit menu and select undo.
        Increase the gamma factor (multiply by 10) and try again. The mesh should deform slower, and hopefully improve.</p>

      <h2>Button Descriptions</h2>
      <h4>Previous</h4>previous frame.
      <h4>Next</h4>next frame
      <h4>Show volume</h4>Shows volume in 3D window
      <h4>vol-contrast</h4>Adjust contrast
      <h4>Initialize Mesh...</h4>open intialize mesh tab.
      <h4>Deform</h4>Deform selected mesh until stop is pressed.
      <h4>clear mesh</h4>removes the select mesh
      <h4>connection remesh</h4>Remesh connections by splitting long connections and
      removing short connections. Uses the values min length and max length.
      <h4>raycast remesh</h4>remeshes using a raycast technique.
      <h4>show forces</h4>shows the external forces on mesh
      <h4>x</h4>removes force arrows.
      <h4>show plane</h4>Shows a plane where the furrow plane is positioned.
      <h4>split mesh</h4>splits the currently selected mesh into two meshes. neither mesh will be associated to a track.
      <h4>center</h4>centers the furrow to either the center of the selected mesh, or the center of the image.
      <h4>init</h4>opens a dialog for initializing the furrow location and direction.
      <h4>select</h4>starts a modification session. nodes can be selected for sculpting *advanced*
      <h4>sculpt</h4>for moving individual nodes by moving a cursor.
      <h4>cancel</h4>cancel mesh modification
      <h4>finish</h4>commit changes made by scuplting.

    <div id="parameters">
      <h2>Parameters Descriptions</h2>
      <h4>gamma</h4>Slows deformations, makes algorithm more stable. Default 1000
      <h4>alpha</h4>Stretching stiffness. Default 1.0
      <h4>pressure</h4> Pushes mesh out, (or in if negative.) Small values will cause mesh to shrink slower,
      large values will cause meshes to grow. Default 0.
      <h4>steric neighbors</h4> will cause meshes to repel each other. With a value of zero neighbors are
      completely ignored. Any non-zero value causes all mesh interactions to be checked. This can be slow. Default 0.
      <h4>divisions</h4>A new mesh starts with 20*4^N triangles. Default 2.
      <h4>beta</h4> A curvature smoothing term. A small value is "nice" but not too necessary. A large value
      can be non-intuitive. Default 0.1
